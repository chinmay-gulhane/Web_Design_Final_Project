# Web Design & User Experience Engineering Final Project

# HuskyBites(A Food Delivery Platform)

## Description

HuskyBites is a meal delivery site that allows customers to place orders from neighboring restaurants, which are then delivered by delivery executives. First and foremost, restaurants, delivery executives, and users will form accounts using their phone number and email address. Profile information for delivery executives and users includes their name, phone number, and profile picture. The restaurant account may add, modify, and categorize food products. Users may explore the dining options and place orders. They can also add eateries to their favorites list. Once an order is placed, delivery executives may inspect it, accept it for pickup, and deliver it to the consumer. Based on the service obtained, the consumer can rank the restaurant and delivery executive.
